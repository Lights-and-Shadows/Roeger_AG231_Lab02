# Roeger_AG231_Lab02

This is the repository for AG231, Lab 02.

This lab centers around the use of Vuforia in conjunction with AR technology. In my version, it is used to view a 3D mathematical model of a trefoil knot, and do various things to it. The model comes with a sphere inside that is animated.

The images, in order, are:

1: Holder for the model

2: Toggles the model visible / not visible

3: Starts / stops the animation of the sphere inside

4: Change the color of the sphere

5: Rotate the knot on it's forward axis

6: Display the equations used to make the knot
